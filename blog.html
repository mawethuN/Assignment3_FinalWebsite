                    <article>
                    <p> 
                        This week we were given 2 readings to pick. I chose the Library of Babel by Borges. What I 
                        understood or took away from this reading was that the author who was essentially narrating his 
                        exploration of the somewhat infinite library. He talked about how you could find any type of book 
                        with any word combinations. To me it felt as though he was referring a lot to the way in which the 
                        mind works which sort of resembles the way the internet also functions. Its like a never ending spiral 
                        of learning. 
                        This week I mainly focused on setting up. I had a bit of difficulty setting up GitHub but managed to 
                        get around it after watching the quick tutorial provided by Andre and a bit of extra help from peers. I 
                        still don’t properly know my way around it but there’s more than enough time to figure it out.
                        This week we were tasked with picking 2 websites that we liked and disliked. I personally picked 
                        4Anime as a website I liked and chose Artbreeder as a site I disliked. I dislike Artbreeder because the 
                        background looks incomplete and the fonts look out of place. Also, aesthetically it sort of sucks. I like 
                        4Anime because of how simple it is to use, plus the dark background makes it easier to focus when 
                        watching stuff. It also has cool features like bookmarking and a randomisation button for when you 
                        don’t know what to watch. 
                        My goal for this module is to be comfortable enough to not only explore beyond what is being taught 
                        in class, but to also understand what is being taught

                    <article>
                        <p>
                        This week we focused on html. The reading we had to do was “Why You Should Choose 
                        HTML5” and Lawson, Bruce. What I got or understood from this article is that Lawson 
                        basically goes on about how much better HTML5 is compared to the previous model which is 
                        HTML4. He listed some benefits that the newer version has and one that particularly stood 
                        out to me was the free to use benefit. Often times these programs or models are owned by 
                        companies that require you to pay for an extended use of their product. HTML 5 on the 
                        other hand is not owned by anyone, which means it is a free for all application.
                        This week we started learning about HTML and the basic HTML functions to get started on 
                        the website. I learned how to properly link VSC to GitHub, and how to broadcast our 
                        websites live. This week we also had an interesting lesson on wireframing and Layouts. I 
                        learned that it is essential for there to be an idea before the website is created, sort of like 
                        how an animator would scamp out their work before implementing it and turning it into an 
                        actual animation. I got to start on my design process which is more detailed if you press on 
                        the design link.
                        This week I focused more on wireframing than actually starting on my website, and I have 
                        properly reserved that for week 3.

                        <p>
                        This week we started implementing CSS and HTML into our websites. This week was a bit 
                        slow for me seeing as I had to undergo one more iteration of my wireframing before I could 
                        truly begin working on my website. I could only start working later on in the week after I had 
                        consumed some of the previous weeks lectures. I got started with HTML and laying down 
                        some basics such as Headings, Sections, Links and Pages. I saved the CSS portion for week 4 
                        in order to give myself time to fully understand the HTML basics
                        This weeks reading was Convention and Context, Mailloux, 1983. In this article, Mailloux 
                        highlights the important relationship between Convention and Context. He explains that 
                        context is needed in order for convention to occur, which loosely translates to having prior 
                        knowledge about something to avoid any miscommunications within conversations. I agree 
                        with this article because so much of our culture now mainly derives from the internet. New 
                        words and phrases are established almost everyday. It is now extremely easy for one to be 
                        offended with the slang of this generation if one does not necessarily keep up with the 
                        internet trends and word usage.

                        <p>
                        This week we mainly focused on UI/UX. I found this very helpful seeing as how this week I 
                        also started using CSS to better the Mid-fidelity wireframing of my website. In the first 
                        quarter of the week I focused my attention on colour theory and re-evaluating my lowFidelity wireframing to see whether or not the intended colours would translate well 
                        digitally. I also chose the fonts and sizes of my headings. I further explored CSS and found 
                        that a few functions in HTML are easier to use in the CSS format. What I mean by this is that 
                        instead of having to declare all my headings in bold individually, I could use CSS to encase 
                        everything using a specific class to do one function. This made the proceedings of this 
                        website a lot easier, and it makes for a less messy clutter on my individual pages.
                        I also discovered extra material that further helped with the proceedings of this website. 
                        W3Schools and The Net Ninja are from many resources I have used when working on this 
                        website

                        <p>
                        This weeks reading was Hassenzahl and Tractinsky - 2006 - User experience - a research 
                        agenda. This reading basically highlighted the importance of UX and how it has become 
                        necessary over the years. The article also provides a way in which UX can be researched, 
                        measured and evaluated. The reading also gives insight of how THE EXPERIENTAL, THE 
                        EMOTION AND EFFECT, and BEYOND THE INSTRAMENTAL work together to create a 
                        balanced idea of what UX should be.
                        This week I carried on with the development of my website. I replaced a temporary 
                        background colour with a new background image that I felt is best suitable for my website. I 
                        also started thinking of ways in which the website could reflect who I am visually and settled 
                        on a green and white aesthetic. I also began setting up my GitHub properly in order to be 
                        able to submit or publish to main.
                        I ran into a few challenges, mainly dealing with the CSS. I had issues regarding margins and 
                        spacing that took an annoying amount of time to fully fix. 
                        After I essentially finished implementing everything individually in a separate project, I 
                        started transferring these different components and exercises I have been doing to an new 
                        project. I have run into other errors and setbacks which will be properly tackled in the design 
                        section of the website.

                        Assignment 1 went rather horribly for me. I received a very low mark due to mistakes that 
                        could have been avoided. I didn’t use the correct semantic tags, I didn’t have headers or 
                        footers, I styled using html.Overall my code was scattered, I didn’t structure my content 
                        accordingly, no use of articles. I got too excited with the project and ended up focusing more 
                        on how pretty it looks instead of actually hardcoding my website. Overall I am disappointed 
                        in myself but will try my best tomake it up in Assignment 3. This time I plan on planning 
                        thoroughly before I act.

                        Progress update.
                        For week 9, I took the comments into consideration regarding my website and 
                        how I could fix it. I made the big decision to start all over again with a new 
                        website that could better adhere to the things we have discussed throughout the 
                        duration of this module. I started looking up some ideas of personal websites 
                        that could serve as inspiration for me to use. I am struggling to keep up with the 
                        theory side of the module but hopefully it will all come together in the end. One 
                        of the main websites that have peaked my interest has been Starbucks and 
                        Ariana Grande’s personal website. I also started using Figma to design my high 
                        fidelity wireframes to figure out what structure I want for this website.

                            Progress Update.
                            So far with working on this website, I have come across a very big problem. 
                            This week we were supposed to be focusing on how well JavaScript can add 
                            onto CSS. I have already implemented a majority of the things I want in my 
                            website, but a problem remains, I have already looked into creating a responsive 
                            website without the use of JavaScript and I am now finding it difficult to 
                            incorporate it. I have tried methods within my header whereby I was going to 
                            make the buttons function using JavaScript but after many failed attempts, I 
                            decided to just hard code them via html instead. The more issues I encounter 
                            with JavaScript, the more I cover it up with html. I don’t know If I will even 
                            incorporate html by the time of submission.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It took me a while to realise that when we talk about responsive design, we 
                            dont just mean that one feature whereby the website is able to adjust to 
                            shrinking screen sizes. I think the challenge for me when it comes to responsive 
                            design is how well it can be perceived by the user. I am currently having a hard 
                            time deciding on how to incorporate links that don’t have to take the user out of 
                            my webpage in order to go to the next page. I am however incorporating 
                            sections as a means of being able to scroll through the website with a button that 
                            links to the next article.

                            APIs are like rules that govern how communication with different software will 
                            occur. I am still a bit unfamiliar with them but from what I have gathered about 
                            them, I would use API’s that are more centered around content management, 
                            seeing as how I plan on going about my website in a personal “all about me”
                            way. I feel that maybe there would be constant changes throughout my website 
                            due to my constant change of hobbies and ideas. I have still yet to conduct
                            proper research on them.

                            Reading
                            This week we discussed "Traveling While Trans" from Costanza-Chock, S. 
                            (2020) Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need. 
                            What I took away from this is that although it may often come up that airport 
                            travel is a nightmare in itself, it is an entirely different ballgame for people who 
                            are Transgender. Not only do they face discrimination in a place that is deemed 
                            as public or of use to everyone, but the subtle feeling of not belonging is a 
                            prevalent thing that I have noticed. In the article, they talked about how the 
                            system operator was confused on whether to press the pink or blue button to 
                            signify gender. I feel like systems need to have bigger upgrades now that he 
                            world is waking up and becoming more inclusive. The system is well known for 
                            enforcing misogynistic ideals of what society should look like but those ideals 
                            are of the past.

                            For this weeks reading, I chose to look at Kasapis - 2020 - Internet Access is a 
                            Fundamental Right. This blog post essentially highlighted the importance of the 
                            internet during the Pandemic and how crucial it was to have it as a business. 
                            Towards the end, questions were asked regarding the policing of the internet 
                            should it become a fundamental right. That question stuck with me because we 
                            are already having issues with trolls and acts of misconduct across the internet, 
                            whereby some social media platforms are deemed as no gos for people who 
                            may be sensitive or empathetic. I believe it is very possible to police the way in 
                            which the internet is used but that may infringe on another fundamental right, 
                            which is freedom of expression.

                            a Pandemic. [online]. Available at: Internet Access is a Fundamental Right

                            Progress Update
                            This week I consulted with a lecturer regarding the steps I can take to better my 
                            website and areas where I can work on. I was primarily told to work on m
                            semantic markup and the structuring of my code. Though I felt a bit discouraged
                            seeing as how unwell I seem to be doing throughout this course overall, I will 
                            continue to try my be to implement this work until I get a website that is able to 
                            function well and that ticks off all the boxes in the rubric. I have implemented
                            all the pages of my website but I still have yet to make them responsive
