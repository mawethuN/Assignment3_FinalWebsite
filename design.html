                    <h2>PLANNING AND INSPO</h2>
                    <p>The process of designing this website was not an easy one. I have spent time and time again, scrapping ideas only to bring them back. What you see before you is the result of hours of iteration and constant breakdowns.</p>
                    <p>Initially, The design of this website was meant to mimic the Ulwazi website in its form and structure. Though executed poorly, I found key aspects of the actual website that I could keep for this latest iteration. The main websites I drew inspiration from were Ulwazi, Steve Jobs biography website, and Starbucks.</p>

                    <h2>CSS</h2>
                    <p>Starbucks was analysed and used for aesthetic UX purposes. The majority of the CSS styling for my website was heavily influenced by the American coffee site. I analysed the colour scheme , the header and footer, along with the use of images and white space. The simplicity of the website prompted me to leave behind my previous chaotic design to make way for a more simple and quiet visual to occur.</p>
                    <p>The font chosen for this website was the default font, which I assume is Times New Roman. This font was chosen mainly because it's not too eye catching to the point whereby it creates busyness on the screen, but it's simple enough to get the message across without taking too much of the attention.</p>
                    <p>I chose the colours Green and white because I feel as though they best represent me. I am a plant lover and I mostly associate the colour green with peace. In a way, these colours were chosen to give off an atmosphere of relaxation and fresh air.</p>

                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                    <p>For the HTML component, I looked at the structuring of the ulwazi page. After the first website submission, I modelled all my wireframes according to Ulwazi using a wireframe website called Figma. In my eyes, it is the most efficient site when it comes to organised work and simple structuring. You know where everything is and it is fairly simple to navigate the website. It is easier to get the basic message across without the use of there being too much or too little going on in the website. As you can see with the images provided, I may have not fully followed through with the actual planned wireframe, but it uses the same template nonetheless</p>

                    <h2>JavaScript Maybe</h2>
                    <p>For the JavaScript component I will be frankly honest and admit I did not incorporate a lot of it in this website, solely due to the fact that what I already had using HTML and CSS already felt solid to me. I had a fear of breaking my website when we eventually started learning about JavaScript so it wasnâ€™t  easy incorporating it. Nonetheless, where I did incorporate JavaScript was to make the UI/UX feel as seamless as the Steve Jobs website. I feel as though websites that are simple looking like that one often have the cooler tricks up their sleeve. I saw that the transitions between sections or articles were very fluid. The thing that caught my eye the most was the use of the buttons. On the website, the logo resembles a key that is a button. When pressed, that key opens the door to other pages of the website, to which I found mind-blowing. So in my small efforts, I tried incorporating the use of buttons in my website to replace the highlighted links.</p>
