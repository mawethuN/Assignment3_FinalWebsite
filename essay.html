                INTRODUCTION
                Have you ever opened an app and immediately knew you did not like it? Or how about logging 
                onto a social media platform and discovering new features added in, and having to take a short, 
                forced tutorial? Have you ever just stopped using an app because you just couldn’t understand 
                how it worked? These seemingly minor issues are part of a larger topic that has to do with 
                UI/UX design.
                <br>
                In this essay, the topic that will be discussed is UI/UX ethical design. This topic mainly aims 
                to unpack the theory behind ethical design within the digital space and the ways in which to 
                identify and work ethically within digital spaces. This essay will include a thorough analysis 
                of the chosen website, YouTube, and a few suggestions on how it could better in order to
                counter UI/UX related issues. This essay will use reading done throughout the course, articles 
                related to UI/UX. The following topics will be discussed, namely:
                • UI/UX Design: Why is it so important?
                • Structures for Analysing Unethical Designs: YouTube Case Study
                Which will then be concluded with a summary and further thoughts regarding the topic at hand.
                <br>
                UI/UX DESIGN:
                WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?
                According to Coursera, User Interface is the visual elements that are displayed on the screen. 
                These elements include the screen itself, buttons and other visual interactive elements one 
                may encounter on either a device or website. It’s basically what the user can click or interact 
                with on the screen using a controller or mouse. UX, User eXperience, is essentially the way 
                in which the user feels when interacting with the elements. It panders more towards the user 
                or player’s reaction towards the User Interface and goes according to how much they either 
                liked or disliked it. 
                Now to the most important question I’m probably sure everyone asks themselves, why 
                UI/UX? What is so important about it?
                The simple way to answer this question is that UI and UX are essentially the foundation of 
                everything that you see online. Without User Interface, there wouldn’t be any interactables 
                within a website or mobile. What I am implying is that without things to fidget or play with 
                on the screen, it would simply resemble an ongoing TV-like program where things happen on 
                screen, but you are unable to participate. Small things like power buttons, start buttons, exit 
                buttons are extremely crucial to any app, product, or platform.
                <br>
                STRUCTURES FOR ANALYSING ETHICAL UI/UX DESIGN:
                YOUTUBE CASE STUDY
                According to a PowerPoint slide by Peta Goldberg called “A CRASH COURSE IN USER 
                EXPERIENCE INTERFACE DESIGN”, There are basic principles that designs must adhere to 
                for them to be classified as ethical. These principles are namely: Readability and Legibility,
                Visual Weight, Balance and Alignment, Visual Directions, Law of Locality, Hierarchy and 
                Scale, Focal Points, Harmony, and Shapes. Each of these principles dictate whether the UI/UX 
                will be ethically successful, and each have their own sub sections to further analyse what is 
                being reviewed. For this case study, I have chosen to apply these principles to the popular 
                website or app, YouTube.
                <br>
                READABILITY AND LEGIBILITY
                The font that is utilized on the YouTube website is called Roboto, which differs from its original 
                font Ariel Black that was used in the past. The webpage's CSS properties have been set in order 
                to establish distinct letter spacings for specific elements. For instance, the sub headline link on 
                the page has a letter spacing of 0.15 pixels, while the regular link and thumbnail attribution are 
                set at 0.25 and 0.3 pixels respectively. 
                This provides users with a consistent and organized visual experience on the website. In terms 
                of webpage design, the CSS code plays a crucial role in determining the font size of various 
                elements. For instance, the height of the channel line is set to 3.2rem, while the height of the 
                navbar title is fixed at 2.6rem. Similarly, the sub headline is assigned a height of 2.2rem, while 
                the regular link uses a height of 2rem. Moreover, the CSS code specifies a font size of 1.2rem 
                for the thumbnail attribution. 
                These proportions make it easier to read and engage with the videos. Another thing I have 
                noticed is the difference in colour. The headings or titles are all solid black and they are bold, 
                whereas the channel name, views, and the time when the video was posted, is all in grey. I think 
                this was done to make the title stand out to be more eye-catching to the viewer. By prioritising 
                the topic, viewers can quickly decide whether this interests them without the need of going to 
                the actual channel, only to be uninterested.
                <br>
                VISUAL WEIGHT
                When it comes to visual weight, YouTube has a more symmetrical balance. From analysing the 
                centre of the screen, all the videos are arranged in orderly rows and columns with even spacing 
                around them. I would say that the weight of the content is asymmetrically imbalanced because 
                YouTube pushes the picture or visuals first before the lettering and fonts. This does bring a 
                sense of balance, as stated in the lecture slide and video, even though they may be totally 
                different. This is a good thing to push forward due to people being more attracted to visuals 
                than words. According to EdApp.com, 65% of the world’s population are visual learners. This 
                means regardless of what information is put out, the majority will always flock towards the 
                first source with colourful pictures. So, YouTube utilising this information is a prime example 
                of ethical UX/UI design.
                <br>
                BALANCE AND ALIGNMENT
                Each column of the centre part of the YouTube page is aligned at the centre. Although the fonts 
                and lettering may have an edge alignment unlike the visual representation, which is aligned at 
                the centre. I think its safe to say I understand this alignment due to there being a picture next 
                to the words underneath the video (referring to the main page), There had to be a sort of shift 
                that won’t make everything look unaligned and unruly.
                <br>
                VISUAL DIRECTIONS
                With regards to the location of the elements, I would say there is no instance whereby the 
                inventory bar overshadows the main centre of the home page, which are the videos. With the 
                way it is positioned, it actually makes it easier to locate the other important features this 
                platform has to offer, such as discover tags, side bars for subscriptions and playlists, and so on.
                The shape of the videos is rectangular, which is a good thing with regards to spacing and 
                alignment. It is far easier to engage with something that looks uniform like a rectangle than to 
                have a row of circular icons next to each other. Plus rectangular elements allow for there to be 
                a comfortable space between each element for typography to reside.
                YouTube does have a grid like structure with the previously mentioned rectangles being aligned
                next to each other. There is no subject matter that suggests any direction within this platform 
                besides the navigation bar.
                <br>
                LAW OF LOCALITY
                There is no doubt that YouTube has changed its hierarchies throughout the years, and it might 
                have been for the better. Using the website version of YouTube on my computer, the first thing 
                I identified was the search bar. It was put in a place whereby the user does not have to look far 
                to find. Another interesting thing is the topics that are now at the top, underneath the search 
                bar. YouTube implemented this as a new feature for when users want to watch a specific niche 
                of content without having to search and constantly alter the home page algorithm.
                <br>
                HIERARCHY AND SCALE
                As stated in the other topics, The tag line that contains the logo appears first, followed by the 
                search bar, followed by the content, then by the side bar or inventory bar. The scaling of these 
                elements is not fairly proportioned seeing as how the content takes up much of the screen space 
                compared to the search bar. This was done for specific reasons of course but this was said to 
                mainly point out the scaling element.
                <br>
                FOCAL POINTS
                I could not find a clear indication of a focal point on YouTube, but there is a feature whereby 
                if a user is watching something but still wants to explore the page, the minimisation of that 
                page will occur and the small window will be placed at the bottom right corner of the screen. 
                This creates a blocking element whereby the user wants to see the elements blocked by the 
                window. Personally I don’t think this is a good ethical design because it can become irritating 
                and may subsequently result in the window being removed. The information that was being 
                relayed has been cut short.
                There being no focal point might also be an example of unethical design as there is nothing 
                persuading the user to look for more information.
                <br>
                HARMONY
                With regards to YouTube, I can see more incorporations of proximity and continuation. I say 
                this because the overall structure of YouTube has become one of convenience. Everything 
                being fitted onto the homescreen and being a click away without having to use a lot of moving 
                around is something I think YouTube has achieved.
                <br>
                CONCLUSION
                To conclude this essay, I would like to state that UI/UX is a very important step when creating
                media platforms that users will interact with. Furthermore, using the 12 principles of ethical 
                design practice, the case study was fully analysed and was overall had a pretty ethical design, 
                with a few things that could be improved here and there.
