                    "The greatest danger of artificial intelligence is that it will remain exactly as it 
is: devoid of all consciousness, but vastly more intelligent than any human 
being." - Nick Bostrom
INTRODUCTION
Humanity has always been praised as the Apex predators of the world we live in.
Often times we wholeheartedly believe that there is nothing alive in this world
that we would have to fear due to our advance technology and mindset. Humanity 
is rather well known for its own demise like waging wars and disrupting the 
natural order of the world with machines and new age technology. We as humans 
have always been on survival mode 24/7 and use technology to ease that pressure 
and do the work for us, but what happens when that technology does it’s job a bit 
too well? What happens when humanity realises that they may have slowly started 
developing the real Apex predators?
In this essay, we will be discussing the topic of mitigating the risk of extinction 
from artificial intelligence and why it must be a global priority alongside other 
societal scale risks. Using an article from the guardian by Kari Paul, I will be 
highlighting why it is necessary for us to keep a regular check on Artificial 
Intelligence and why it is deemed as dangerous as pandemics and nuclear wars.
The main goal of this essay is to justify the statement on AI risk on the Center of 
AI Safety website, and why so many scientists have signed onto this statement. It 
is also to highlight the chosen framework, The World in www and Digital 
Inequalities .The justification of this statement will be discussed under the 
following topics, namely:
• The Statement: Why CAIS is important
• Erosion of truth and AI risk
This will followed by a swift conclusion that sums up all my thoughts related to 
this topic.
EROSION OF TRUTH AND AI RISK
Throughout the 2000s, parents everywhere would constantly repeat one and the 
same thing to their children. It may change as the years go by but the consistent 
“it’s because of that damn phone!” will forever be cemented as a parent’s g to 
phrase for anything that goes wrong when their children are entrusted with a task 
to complete. In many ways, these parents were onto something.
The late 2000, or our current wave, has seen an internet boom occur with regards 
to social communication. Social media is currently the major source of 
information reported by the minute. Back then, people would gather around the 
living room to listen to the 8 o’clock news, whereby every major story would be 
reported on and would only continue to be reported on the following day at 8 
o’clock. The news stations and radio stations would put ridiculous hours into 
doing research and would have teams dedicated to making sure that this 
information is indeed credible and accurate. There was a fixed regulated system 
in which information was to be distributed. For those who prefer to take their time 
digesting the information slowly, newspapers were bought or delivered to 
doorsteps. That is how the happenings of the world were tracked before the social 
media craze.
Since the introduction of fast internet communication, we have seen a number of
journal pages that, unlike the TV and newspaper system, have resulted in 
reporting the events, except with little to no proof to back up any claims. You may 
be wondering where I am going with this and how this relates to AI but I promise 
you, this has a lot to do with Artificial intelligence and the way in which it has 
been used to spread false narratives.
In the Article, Paul states that there is an ongoing war against machine learning, 
whereby it is easy to consume false information (Paul; 2023). Due to our time 
being consumed by our phones, we now expect everything to be reported 
immediately. There are “journal pages” on social media that have dedicated 
themselves to reporting live events by the minute. This is largely influenced by 
the fact that most social media is regulated by AI algorithms that were built to 
catapult information deemed necessary to the top of everyone’s feed. This is 
especially harmful because now AI will focus more on what causes discourse
instead of focusing on tangible information. This in turn creates a situation 
whereby everyone thinks their opinion is factual due to AI algorithms using 
historically inaccurate and outdated models that create exclusion and have sinister 
undertones (Birhane, Cummins; 2019). The main issue with this is that these 
systems rely heavily on prediction which is drawn from inaccurate information 
that proves to do more harm than good, and causes divisions (Birhane, Cummins; 
2019).
The most important thing to note about Artificial Intelligence is that at the end of 
the day, it is a tool. Artificial Intelligence is exactly that, an artificial manifestation 
of large quantities of information. AI does not have a conscious and is merely a 
system that is used to enhance workflow or a system. The most harmful thing 
about AI so far is its ability to communicate in a human like manner. We as people 
are now quick to believe anything is true if told in a certain manner. Multiple 
people have had the misfortune of taking the word of AI as emotionally correct 
which result in a lot unfortunate circumstances (Paul; 2023). These things further 
highlight how increasingly dangerous AI has become and should it advance to the 
point of creating its own sense of “consciousness”, it may perpetuate falsehood
in its favour and create havoc that far exceeds that of war.
THE STATEMENT: WHY CAIS IS IMPORTANT
Artificial Intelligence has come a long way since its early days. We went from 
Turing tests to asking ChatGPT to write a break up text. It is safe to say that 
Artificial intelligence is evolving at an extremely fast rate, which is why many 
are calling for it to either be slowed down or stopped altogether.
CAIS is an online organisation that has dedicated their cause to reducing the 
societal scale risks imposed by AI. It was founded by Bri Treece, Dan Hendrycks,
Oliver Zhang. CAIS stands for Center for Artificial Intelligence Safety, and their 
main mission is to equip policy makers to best prepare for anything that may go 
wrong. The creation of this website is a clear indication of a problem spoken 
about within the article whereby people are now preparing themselves for any 
sort of “Doomsday” event relating to the irresponsible use of AI (Paul, 2023). A 
majority of the people who co-signed under this statement on the website are 
mainly scientists, CEO’s, or leaders of some sort. The main reason for this is due 
to how these businesses could greatly influence and impact the doomsday events 
that could occur due to the misuse of Artificial Intelligence. In the Article, it is 
stated that “AI could replace the equivalent of 85m jobs worldwide by 2025 and 
more than 300m in the long term” (Paul, 2023).
This is a clear example of how easy it is for the unemployment stats to skyrocket, 
thus increasing the gap between inflation and minimum wage. In the article, Paul 
also mentions that this may create political unrest within the United States of 
America (Paul, 2023). This is exceptionally bad due to the fact that America is 
considered to be a very powerful country on it’s own, and if America fails to 
handle this AI Pandemic, it may bleed onto the rest of the world and it could 
heavily impact countries reliant on the USA. This is why CAIS mainly aimed to 
recruit powerful people in order to prevent any of this from happening.
Through working together with large corporations, Artificial Intelligence can be 
regulated and used in fair practice.
CONCLUSION
To conclude this essay, I would like to reiterate that there are many things to 
consider when engaging with Artificial Intelligence and that it is a tool of great 
power that is able to sway almost any discussion. I agree that it is a benign 
pandemic that can turn violent at any given time due to the rate it is evolving and 
the carelessness surrounding it.
